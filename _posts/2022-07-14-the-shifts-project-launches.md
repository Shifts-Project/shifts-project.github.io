We&nbsp;are pleased to&nbsp;announce the Shifts Project&nbsp;&mdash; an&nbsp;international collaboration of&nbsp;academic and industrial researchers dedicated to&nbsp;studying distributional shift&nbsp;&mdash; one of&nbsp;the biggest challenges in&nbsp;applying machine learning to&nbsp;high-stakes real-world tasks.

The Shifts Project is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evolution of&nbsp;the Shifts Challenge, which debuted at&nbsp;NeurIPS 2021.

The Shifts Project has three primary goals. First, we&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;cross-disciplinary international community, bringing together core-ML researchers who study distributional shift and applied ML&nbsp;researchers, who work on&nbsp;tasks affected by&nbsp;distributional shift. Currently the Shift Project is&nbsp;comprised of&nbsp;researchers from the Universities of&nbsp;Basel, Lausanne, HES-SO Valais and Cambridge, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;DeepSea.Ai and Yandex Research. We&nbsp;hope that this list will grow over time. Second, we&nbsp;aim to&nbsp;collect new datasets sourced from industry that feature &lsquo;in-the-wild&rsquo; distributional shift and make them freely available. This will enable better research in&nbsp;the area with outcomes that can be&nbsp;directly applied in-production. Finally, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;organizing events, challenges and workshops to&nbsp;popularize these new datasets and raise awareness of&nbsp;the problem of&nbsp;distributional shift among the general ML&nbsp;community.

We&nbsp;will soon be&nbsp;launching the Shifts Challenge&nbsp;2.0 and a&nbsp;host of&nbsp;other activities. To&nbsp;join our community and stay tuned&nbsp;&mdash; follow&nbsp;us on&nbsp;[twitter](https://twitter.com/ShiftsProject), join our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/DnC9mVCYgHhwCGWy5), drop by&nbsp;on&nbsp;[Discord](https://discord.gg/mKMgRSXQnX).

The Shifts Project
