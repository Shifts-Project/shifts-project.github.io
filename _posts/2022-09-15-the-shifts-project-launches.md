We&nbsp;are pleased to&nbsp;announce the launch of&nbsp;the Shifts Project&nbsp;&mdash; an&nbsp;international collaboration of&nbsp;academic and industrial researchers dedicated to&nbsp;studying distributional shift in&nbsp;real-world applications.

Distributional shift, or&nbsp;the mismatch between training and deployment conditions, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest obstacles to&nbsp;the wide-spread adoption of&nbsp;and impact of&nbsp;AI across all industries. Distributional shift is&nbsp;ubiquitous in&nbsp;real-world ML&nbsp;applications and can cause a&nbsp;degradation in&nbsp;model performance. This is&nbsp;especially critical in&nbsp;applications with strict safety requirements, such as&nbsp;autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Ideally, machine learning models should perform reliably across a&nbsp;broad range of&nbsp;conditions and, if&nbsp;they fail to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, should indicate that via estimates of&nbsp;uncertainty. The lack of&nbsp;large and diverse datasets with examples of &lsquo;in-the-wild&rsquo; distributional shifts from a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;real-world applications makes it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;develop such models. The primary obstacle that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;overcome to&nbsp;obtain such data is&nbsp;the limited communication between researchers studying distributional shift and practitioners working on&nbsp;applications affected by&nbsp;distributional shift.

The Shifts Project has three primary goals. First, we&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;cross-disciplinary international community, bringing together researchers who study distributional shift and practitioners who work on&nbsp;tasks affected by&nbsp;distributional shift. Second, we&nbsp;aim to&nbsp;collect new datasets sourced from industry that feature &lsquo;in-the-wild&rsquo; distributional shift and make them freely available. This will enable better research in&nbsp;the area with outcomes that can be&nbsp;directly applied in-production. Finally, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;organizing events, challenges and workshops to&nbsp;popularize these new datasets and raise awareness of&nbsp;the problem of&nbsp;distributional shift among the general ML&nbsp;community.

Currently the Shift Project members are the organizing team of&nbsp;researchers from the Universities of&nbsp;Basel, Lausanne, HES-SO Valais and Cambridge, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;DeepSea and Yandex Research. We&nbsp;hope that this list will grow over time as&nbsp;the community grows and expands. Our desire is&nbsp;that the Shifts Project evolves into a&nbsp;self-sustaining community of&nbsp;researchers and&nbsp;ML practitioners who will drive the development of&nbsp;robust, reliable and safe ML&nbsp;systems.

Our first major event will be&nbsp;the Shifts Challenge 2022, which will last from September 15th to&nbsp;April 1st 2023&nbsp;&mdash; find out more [here](/2022/09/15/shifts-challenge-begins.html)! We&nbsp;are also planning a&nbsp;host of&nbsp;other events later on&nbsp;throughout the year. To&nbsp;join our community and stay tuned&nbsp;&mdash; follow&nbsp;us on&nbsp;[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShiftsProject), join our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/DnC9mVCYgHhwCGWy5) and drop by&nbsp;on&nbsp;[Discord](https://discord.gg/mKMgRSXQnX).
