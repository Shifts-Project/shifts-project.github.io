          "text": "Distributional shift is&nbsp;the mismatch between training and deployment data. Generalizing to &lsquo;shifted&rsquo; data is&nbsp;challenging for ML&nbsp;models. Typically, the performance of&nbsp;ML modes will drop as&nbsp;the degree of&nbsp;shift increases. For example, both human and&nbsp;AI drivers trained to&nbsp;drive on&nbsp;the right side of&nbsp;the road can struggle in&nbsp;countries with left-sided driving. Distributional shift is&nbsp;ubiquitous in&nbsp;machine learning and is&nbsp;especially important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;in&nbsp;safety-critical applications."

Conclusions drawn from these datasets rarely carry over to&nbsp;industrial-scale ML&nbsp;applications. The lack of&nbsp;large, diverse and industrially sourced datasets with examples of &lsquo;real&rsquo; distributional shifts makes it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;validate new approaches and reach conclusions that are broadly applicable to&nbsp;real-life applications.",

If&nbsp;they fail to&nbsp;generalize, these models should indicate this using uncertainty estimates, which enables&nbsp;us to&nbsp;take actions that improve the safety and reliability of&nbsp;the ML&nbsp;system. Techniques that induce invariant or&nbsp;equivariant representations, prevent feature collapse and allow learning more information from data will improve generalization. Techniques which yield quantities sensitive to&nbsp;the degree of&nbsp;distributional shift will yield better uncertainty estimates."

This will enable better research in&nbsp;the area with outcomes that can be&nbsp;directly applied in-production. The Shifts Project will be&nbsp;organizing events, challenges and workshops to&nbsp;popularize these new datasets and raise awareness of&nbsp;the problem of&nbsp;distributional shift among the general ML&nbsp;community."
