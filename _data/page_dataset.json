People rely on&nbsp;these forecasts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accurate so&nbsp;that they can confidently plan their day, weekends and holidays. However, the weather is&nbsp;a&nbsp;complex, highly non-stationary system which evolves over time&nbsp;&mdash; the weather on&nbsp;May 5th 2021&nbsp;is likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different from May 5th 2022. Furthermore, ground-stations and meteorological radar are not uniformly distributed around the world&nbsp;&mdash; there is&nbsp;less information available about some locations. Ground-stations can also fail to&nbsp;communicate and transmit their readings. Finally, weather data is&nbsp;presented in&nbsp;heterogeneous tabular form, which not all&nbsp;ML models can handle well. ML&nbsp;weather forecasting systems need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;robust to&nbsp;shifts in&nbsp;time, location, and missing values and work well with tabular data to&nbsp;regularly produce reliable and accurate forecasts, especially in&nbsp;coastal and mountainous regions, where the weather can be&nbsp;hazardous. They should also indicate when they are unable to&nbsp;provide an&nbsp;accurate forecast. To&nbsp;better investigate robustness and uncertainty estimation in&nbsp;heterogeneous tabular data, the Yandex Weather service has provided the Shifts Weather Forecasting dataset. This data is&nbsp;also valuable as&nbsp;it&nbsp;represents similar challenges to&nbsp;the ones faced in&nbsp;high-risk applications, such as&nbsp;medical diagnostics and financial forecasting, which often contain a&nbsp;heterogeneous feature set, drift over time, non-uniform distribution over sub-populations and missing values."

Specifically, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular latitude, longitude, and timestamp, one must predict either the air temperature at&nbsp;two meters above the ground or&nbsp;the precipitation class, given targets and features derived from weather station measurements and weather forecast models. The data consists of&nbsp;10&nbsp;million 129-column entries: 123 meteorological features, 4&nbsp;meta-data attributes (time, latitude, longitude and climate type) and 2&nbsp;targets&nbsp;&mdash; temperature (target for regression task) and precipitation class (target for classification task). It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;note that the features are highly heterogeneous, i.e., they are of&nbsp;different types and scales. The full data is&nbsp;distributed uniformly between September 1&nbsp;st, 2018, and September 1&nbsp;st, 2019, with samples across all climate types. This data is&nbsp;used by&nbsp;Yandex for real-time weather forecasts and represents a&nbsp;real industrial application. \n\nTo&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;standard benchmark that contains both in-domain and shifted data, we&nbsp;define a&nbsp;particular &ldquo;canonical partitioning&rdquo; of&nbsp;the full dataset into training, development (dev), and evaluation (eval) datasets. The training, in-domain dev (dev_in) and in-domain eval (eval_in) data consist of&nbsp;measurements made from September 2018 till April 8th, 2019 for climate types Tropical, Dry, and Mild Temperate. The shifted dev (dev_out) data consists of&nbsp;measurements made from 8th July till 1st September 2019 for the climate type Snow. 50K data points are sub-sampled for the climate type Snow within this time range to&nbsp;construct dev_out. The shifted eval data is&nbsp;further shifted than the out-of-domain development data; measurements are taken from 14th May till 8th July 2019, which is&nbsp;more distant in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the year from the in-domain data compared to&nbsp;the out-of-domain development data. The climate types are restricted to&nbsp;Snow and Polar. See [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07455) for further details."

Therefore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important for models to&nbsp;both be&nbsp;robust to&nbsp;atypical language use to&nbsp;provide high-quality translations, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;to&nbsp;indicate when they are unable to&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;quality translation.

During development, most self-driving companies concentrate their fleet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few locations. Robustly generalizing from old locations to&nbsp;new ones is&nbsp;challenging, as&nbsp;new locations can differ in&nbsp;routes, driving styles, types of&nbsp;cars, road signs and so&nbsp;on. Thus, fleets face distributional shift when they begin operating in&nbsp;new locations. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also critical for a&nbsp;planning model to&nbsp;recognize when this transferred knowledge is&nbsp;insufficient upon encountering unfamiliar data. For example, when the model&rsquo;s uncertainty is&nbsp;high, the vehicle can exercise extra caution or&nbsp;request assistance from a&nbsp;remote operator. \n\nMotion prediction is&nbsp;among the most important problems in&nbsp;the autonomous driving domain. It&nbsp;involves predicting the distribution over possible future states of&nbsp;other agents around the self-driving car at&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;moments in&nbsp;time to&nbsp;avoid planning a&nbsp;potential collision. This problem is&nbsp;complicated by&nbsp;the fact that the future is&nbsp;inherently uncertain. For example, we&nbsp;cannot know the high-level navigational goals of&nbsp;other agents, or&nbsp;even their low-level tendency to&nbsp;turn right or&nbsp;left at&nbsp;a&nbsp;T-junction if&nbsp;they fail to&nbsp;indicate. In&nbsp;order for the planning module to&nbsp;make the right decision, this uncertainty must be&nbsp;precisely quantified. This is&nbsp;complicated by&nbsp;motion prediction being a&nbsp;continuous structured prediction task, making it&nbsp;non-trivial to&nbsp;obtain meaningful measures of&nbsp;uncertainty. Altogether, this makes motion prediction an&nbsp;interesting task for investigating uncertainty estimation and robustness to&nbsp;distributional shift. To&nbsp;this end, the Yandex Self-Driving Group has provided the Shifts Vehicle Motion Prediction dataset to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used for examining the implications of&nbsp;distributional shift in&nbsp;self-driving vehicles."

The dataset consists of&nbsp;10&nbsp;measurements sampled every minute from sensors on-board a&nbsp;merchant vessel over a&nbsp;span of&nbsp;4&nbsp;years, cleaned and augmented with weather data from a&nbsp;third-party provider. The target is&nbsp;the vessel&rsquo;s main engine shaft power, i.e. the energy it&nbsp;expends per second to&nbsp;maintain its speed. The task is&nbsp;to&nbsp;predict this power (which in&nbsp;turn can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;predict fuel consumption given an&nbsp;engine model) from the vessel&rsquo;s speed, draft, time since last dry dock cleaning and various weather and sea conditions. Thus, altogether, each record contains 12&nbsp;entries&nbsp;&mdash; 10&nbsp;features, 1&nbsp;time index and 1&nbsp;target. Distributional shift arises from hull performance degradation over time due to&nbsp;fouling, sensor calibration drift, and variations in&nbsp;non-measured sea conditions such as&nbsp;water temperature and salinity, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;sensor noise, measurement and transmission errors, and uncertainty in&nbsp;historical weather.

The dataset contains scans from multiple clinical centers: Rennes, Bordeaux, Lyon, Ljubljana, Best and Lausanne. Patient scans from different locations vary in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;scanner models, local annotation guidelines, scanner strengths and resolution of&nbsp;raw scans. For standardized benсhmarking we&nbsp;have created a&nbsp;canonical partitioning of&nbsp;the data into in-domain train, development (dev) and evaluation (eval) sets as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;shifted development and evaluation sets. For locations containing multiple scans per patient care is&nbsp;taken to&nbsp;ensure the multiple scans are kept separate between Train/Dev and Eval. The locations Rennes, Bordeaux, Lyon and Best are treated as&nbsp;in-domain and the locations Ljubljana and Lausanne are treated as&nbsp;publicly available and held-out distributionally shifted development and evaluation sets, respectively. The Lausanne portion of&nbsp;the data will not be&nbsp;publicly released, but it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;freely evaluate models on&nbsp;it&nbsp;via Grand-Challenge.
